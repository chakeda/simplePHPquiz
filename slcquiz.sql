('Research', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders can often get inundated with the vast amount of information being produced and shared in a variety of formats, some of which is useful and some is extraneous to the leaders\\'' needs. It is important that leaders can produce and distinguish useful, legitimate information that is most applicable to each leadership situation.  ', 1),
('Other Perspectives', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders do not have all the answers. Thus, it is essential that they are able to truly consider other opinions, experiences, and outlooks to help them develop better solutions and approaches when dealing with leadership situations. Not only can this lead to better outcomes, but considering other perspectives helps leaders relate to and appreciate others more by better understanding their viewpoints.', 2),
('Reflection and Application', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Being able to look at the past and better understand a situation, the strategies used, and the impact of decisions can help a leader learn what might work best in future situations. It is through learning from failures and successes of the past that leaders can better lead in future leadership situations.', 3),
('Systems Thinking', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leadership is about networks: individual, organizational, and community. A decision by one can have an impact far beyond the immediate scope of the decision maker. Therefore, leaders must be able to understand how networks work and be able to navigate through both the ripple effects of others\\'' decisions as well as engage in their own decision making that considers the impact on a larger network or system.', 4),
('Analysis', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders are confronted every day with decisions that may have a large impact financially, organizationally, politically, socially, and/or interpersonally. With this responsibility comes the great need to understand a situation in its entirety, all the individual pieces as well as the whole, to make meaning of the situation and make the best decision possible. ', 5),
('Synthesis', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'As the creation of information continues to grow, the demand for effectively managing that information is a necessary function of leadership. Leaders must be able to look at a variety of information, some seemingly unrelated, and connect that information to make sense of the bigger picture so that effective and sustainable decisions can be made.', 6),
('Evaluation', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders make difficult decisions every day. In order to make the best decision possible, leaders must be able to sift through a vast array of information with a critical eye, determining the use and importance of every piece of information received. Leaders must be able to look at all of this information and determine which information has the most impact on their situation and which information is just interesting. Navigating through this vast array of information and determining what is useful, to what extent, and how it is useful can help inform the leaders in making effective decisions. ', 7),
('Problem Solving', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Although everyone is confronted with problems, because leaders are connected to a larger system, problem solving can often have higher stakes for a group or organization. So, the ability to effectively solve problems is paramount for leaders. Effective problem solving has the opportunity to prevent damage, achieve a successful and productive outcome, refrain from negatively affecting others and in some cases positively affect others, and prevent a problem from reoccurring.', 8),
('Decision Making', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders are continually engaged in leadership situations that require decisions to be made. Each decision to be made is situated in a context that includes factors affecting a specific decision, such as people involved or affected, time, and resources. Understanding this context can help a leader make the most effective, productive, and sustainable decision appropriate for that exact situation.', 9),
('Idea Generation', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leadership issues are complex; they can involve a variety of people, perspectives, and circumstances. This complexity often does not call for a one size fits all approach. Therefore, it is vital that leaders are able to generate new ideas that effectively address issues in an ever-changing landscape. ', 10),
('Self-Understanding', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Self-awareness is vital to effective leadership. Not understanding how one might respond to change or working from one\\''s weaknesses while thinking they are strengths can have devastating impacts on others. However, when a leader understands his or her feelings, beliefs, actions, and personality, he or she can emphasize strengths and mitigate weaknesses in his or her leadership style and lead with more authenticity and in a more productive manner.', 11),
('Personal Values', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Values are a guiding force for individual behavior. Being aware of one\\''s own values can help a leader prioritize organizational initiatives and make decisions aligned with those values. And, leaders who demonstrate their values through leadership can inspire others to work with them. ', 12),
('Personal Contributions', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Everyone has assets, those aspects of themselves that are helpful and contributory, including ideas, strengths, knowledge, and abilities. Leaders who know what their assets are can tap into them to lead more effectively. A leader who contributes the strength of compassion when someone in the group falls on hard times can positively affect others, or a leader who contributes the ability of website design when others in the organization lack that ability can contribute positively to a needed task. Leaders give of themselves to make their organizations better.', 13),
('Scope of Competence', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Engaging in a task outside one\\''s capabilities can have harmful effects on others and organizations. Just as important as it is to know one\\''s own strengths, skills, and talents that one may bring to a situation, it is just as vital for a leader to know what he or she does not bring to the situation. By recognizing one\\''s own limitations, the leader can engage in those tasks that he or she is capable of and refer those outside of his or her scope of competence to others more competent at the task at hand. ', 14),
('Receiving Feedback', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'For a leader to continue to develop as well as enhance his or her effectiveness with others, being self-aware is essential. Sometimes, however, a leader cannot simply self-assess his or her own competencies or behavior because there are elements that are not visible to the leader in the same way as they are to others. So, these areas often either go unaddressed or are not addressed in the best manner. Being able to consider feedback from others is crucial for a leader to best develop his or her competencies and increase his or her effectiveness with others.', 15),
('Self-Development', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Whether it is learning new technology or how to become a better public speaker, leaders are always learning. They may do this voluntarily, like seeking out training, or out of necessity based on the leader\\''s role or the group\\''s needs.', 16),
('Productive Relationships', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leadership requires that a leader has meaningful connections with others; simply interacting with people does not constitute a relationship. A leader who cultivates productive, mutually beneficial relationships with others can create a trusting environment in which people care about each other. This allows for channels of communication to open for the emergence of new ideas and honest dialogue, a personal and professional support structure to develop, and a shared commitment for a vision or task to be created.', 17),
('Appropriate Interaction', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Everyone is different, whether because of a situation, a personality, or a set of circumstances. Leaders must understand this context and gauge their interactions to respect the boundaries, needs, and styles of others. ', 18),
('Helping Others', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are times in people\\''s jobs, families, or personal lives in which they could benefit from assistance, whether to make something less difficult or less time consuming. Because leaders care about people, they know how valuable it is to help others and foster an environment in which people help each other. ', 19),
('Others Contributions', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leaders know that the unique ideas, strengths, knowledge, and abilities that individuals bring to a task or relationship are assets, because no one person has every great idea or a mastery of all competencies, and certainly leaders cannot do it all alone. Leaders understand this and integrate others\\'' ideas, strengths, and abilities to better address an issue, strengthen a relationship, solve a problem, or engage in innovation.   ', 20),
('Empathy', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Empathy plays an important role in leadership. Not only can demonstrating empathy with others build relationships and a sense of trust, it can also help a leader understand another point of view or other set of circumstances to effectively inform the leader', 21),
('Supervision', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'In many cases, leaders oversee the work of others, whether formally or informally. Thus, it is essential that leaders are able to effectively provide direction to those they supervise so they are clear about what they need to do, the process for doing it, and any expectations the leader has. This direction can provide a sense of clarity and transparency so that others are best situated to complete their intended jobs or tasks.', 22),
('Providing Feedback', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Feedback includes critiques, confirmations, and/or advice that can help another person improve their decisions, effectiveness, productivity, or interactions with others. As a leader, being able to provide feedback to others is essential. This feedback not only assists the one receiving the feedback, but if the feedback that is given is utilized, this can have a positive impact on group functioning and group productivity.', 23),
('Mentoring', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'It is vital that leaders share their knowledge, ability, and/or experience with more novice individuals to help them develop their capacities. Doing so is not just good for the individual, but developing the capacities of others could contribute to team productivity, a greater sense of trust, more group legitimacy, and allow for the workload to be more evenly distributed.', 24),
('Empowerment', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leaders understand the benefit of empowering others. Sharing power, information, and resources allows others to have an investment in a task or process and can provide them a sense of ownership, accountability, and commitment. This may lead to higher-quality work, greater timeliness and follow-through, and greater commitment to the task and team. ', 25),
('Motivation', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are many factors that can influence someone\\''s motivation to complete a task or goal. Some people may be motivated by internal factors such as drive and desire, whereas others may be motivated by external factors like rewards and incentives. It is essential for the leader to understand the unique ways in which people are motivated and engage in specific strategies that motivate each person in the way that is most effective for him or her.', 26),
('Collaboration', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are a variety of situations in which it is more beneficial to work together than to work independently. These may include solving a challenging problem, addressing an ethical dilemma, or simply completing a comprehensive project. Being able to work together allows a multitude of voices and ideas to be considered, an enhanced sense of group commitment and responsibility to occur, and the human power to execute a task to increase. Leaders foster a culture of collaboration and seek to bring people together in intentional ways to benefit the group.', 27),
('Organizational Behavior', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Organizations can be living entities, with the organization and its individuals creating and sustaining their own sense of culture, norms, and practices. Leaders need not only to understand the organization but also to anticipate, navigate, mitigate, and respond effectively to the behaviors of the organization and those in it to lead most effectively in the organizational context.', 28),
('Power Dynamics', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Whether formal or informal, internal and external power dynamics affect nearly every group. These power dynamics may be influenced by position, seniority, resource access, and/or relationships of the group\\''s members or stakeholders. It is vital that leaders understand the types of power dynamics that exist in their groups so they can better respond to the group\\''s needs within the context of these power dynamics.', 29),
('Group Development', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Working together is not just about achieving an outcome; it is about participating in a process. Leaders need to pay attention to the group process ensuring that the group feels a sense of connection and commitment to both the group and to its members. This connection and commitment can foster a sense of trust through which members share ideas, give feedback, follow through, and make difficult decisions. By understanding how groups form and develop, the leader can help foster group development and thus enhance the group\\''s efficiency and effectiveness in an empowering manner.', 30),
('Creating Change', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Nothing stays the same; people change, environments change, and organizations change. Not only is change inevitable, it can be challenging for people, structures, and processes. And, if change is not instituted well, it can be damaging to the group and its members. Thus, it is imperative that when leaders enact change, they are sensitive to the context and people involved.', 31),
('Diversity', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leadership is inherently an interpersonal process, and in many situations, leaders will find themselves in the position of working with individuals who have different backgrounds, beliefs, and/or experiences than they do. The variety of diverse perspectives of those in the group can enhance a group\\''s effectiveness. Instead of a decision being made from only one or maybe two vantage points, differing perspectives can be considered and integrated into the decision. This allows for a decision to not only be more comprehensive, but also more inclusive.', 32),
('Others Circumstances', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'It is critical for leaders to seek to understand the situations and/or conditions of other people. This understanding not only helps inform the leader\\''s decisions but also helps the leader be conscious of what others have experienced or are experiencing so as to engage in inclusive behaviors and connect with others with a sense of care.', 33),
('Social Justice', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leadership exists within a larger social system that often involves an inequitable distribution of social power. Effective leaders have an understanding of social power and the inequities that exist in the distribution of that power, as well as a motivation to lessen or eliminate those inequities. Socially just leaders act in ways that work towards a more equitable distribution of social power and challenge individuals, groups, and systems that reinforce inequity.', 34),
('Inclusion', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leaders do not just lead abstract groups of people for abstract causes; they lead with people and for people. Because people like to feel included, whether to share their viewpoints, contribute to a cause or task, or simply feel a sense of belonging, leaders must foster an inclusive environment.', 35),
('Social Responsibility', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leaders often have the ability to greatly affect others and society through their decisions and actions, whether that effect is positive or negative. Thus, it is vital that leaders engage in responsible decision making and ethical actions so that the impact they leave benefits and does not detract from the welfare of society and its members. ', 36),
('Service', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Serving one\\''s community is essential in creating and maintaining a thriving community. Whether that service is through participation in community processes and decision making, collaborative initiatives, or volunteer positions or experiences, communities are only as strong as their members\\'' commitment and engagement. Leaders model this commitment and engagement to their communities by finding meaningful ways, personally and/or professionally, to participate in service that positively contributes to their communities.', 37),
('Verbal Communication', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Although the context in which they would need to do it varies greatly, leaders frequently need to be able to communicate effectively with others through spoken word, including oral communication, sign language, and/or communication using assistive technology. This may take the form of speaking in front of a crowd, delivering a presentation, running a meeting, or conversing with someone one-on-one, among many others. Regardless of its delivery method, effective verbal communication allows a leader to inform, inspire, influence, counsel, and negotiate in a non-written format.', 38),
('Nonverbal Communication', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Effective communication is more than just communicating words; it is also about body language, gestures, and other cues that convey meaning. Being able to effectively communicate nonverbally allows leaders to fully express their intended meaning and show that they care and they are listening.', 39),
('Listening', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Effective communication is more than just communicating messages to another person; it also involves receiving messages by listening. Leaders know that effective listening can help prevent miscommunication, as well as allow the leader to better understand messages being communicated, gather ideas and feedback, and demonstrate a sense of care about what others want to communicate. ', 40),
('Writing', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Whether writing out a vision or strategic plan, developing a proposal, writing a performance evaluation of another person, or communicating electronically, leaders need to be able to communicate effectively through writing. Failure to write effectively can result in missed opportunities, miscommunication, or even misrepresentation of oneself and one\\''s organization. Effective writing can help leaders organize ideas, showcase accomplishments, and inspire and influence others especially when other forms of communication are not an option.', 41),
('Facilitation', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Groups are powerful engines of problem solving, innovation, and decision-making. To best utilize the group process, leaders need to be able to lead discussions effectively, ask the right questions, and synthesize information. Doing this enables groups to maximize their potential in solving challenging problems, generating new ideas, and making difficult decisions.', 42),
('Conflict Negotiation', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Conflict is inevitable. Leaders may be involved in the conflict or helping others negotiate through the conflict. Regardless, conflict happens. Avoiding or mishandling conflict can result in strained relationships, difficulty for people to work together, and issues of trust; it even has the potential to escalate into acts of harm. To create a safe, respectful, and trusting environment, leaders must be adept at negotiating conflict.', 43),
('Advocating for a Point of View', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Leaders can have opinions about many issues, causes, situations, and ideas. Leaders may strongly favor one thing and maybe just as strongly not favor another. Effectively communicating what they believe is not easy. So, not only does the communication itself need to be clear and understandable to convey the intended meaning, the leader needs to deliver the information in an influential yet respectful manner. Being able to do this ensures the effective transmission of the message as well as allows the leader to demonstrate a commitment to his or her values, exhibit passion, show others that he or she is willing to put his or her reputation on the line to stand by an opinion, and even convince others to believe what he or she believes.', 44),
('Mission', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Knowing one\\''s values and leading with them is vital to individual and organizational leadership. Because a mission statement is a summary of an individualï¿½s or organizationï¿½s values, it can serve as a decision-making compass that ensures that all decisions are made in alignment with the values. On an organizational level, having a mission statement that reflects the values of the organization and its members can help provide guidance and justification for engaging in particular behaviors and can serve as a binding force for those in the organization who stand behind the values. ', 45),
('Vision', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'A vision is an aspiration based on what one imagines the possibilities to be in the future; it is a picture of what one wants the future to look like, as an individual, organization, or community. By having a vision in place, a leader can develop goals, plans, and strategies that align with the vision so as to stay on track, keep motivated, and monitor his or her progress toward achieving the vision. In addition, a vision can create a sense of unity between people as they are inspired to achieve the same outcome.', 46),
('Goals', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Attempting to achieve a vision can be an overwhelming and daunting task because the vision can be very large and/or take place over a lengthy time span. Thus, it is essential to break the vision down into smaller, measurable, and more readily achievable goals that contribute to the achievement of the larger vision. By achieving these goals, one can measure progress towards the vision as well as feel a sense of accomplishment along the way.', 47),
('Plan', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Leaders can be grand thinkers, big dreamers, and aspire to do things no one has ever done. But how do leaders get themselves, others, and their organizations to achieve great things? They must be able to develop a plan to get there. In an effort to reach goals or simply engage in day-to-day organizational operations, leaders must be adept at planning. They must be able to identify tasks and set deadlines so that there is a roadmap in place to get where the leader wants to go.', 48),
('Ethics', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Leaders are not exempt from the standards others are held accountable to; leaders are the model that others follow.

('Resiliency', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'From the perspective of the leader, leadership does not always yield positive results; leaders face challenges and adversity that they cannot overcome, as well as major setbacks and disappointments. But it is the leader who can learn from the experience and rise again to the next challenge who stands out. Many great leaders throughout history have had major setbacks, but we remember them for their ability not only to rise again, but to rise higher than before. ', 50),
('Responding to Change', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Because of environmental needs, innovation, or matters out of one\\''s own control, change can be unpredictable, frequent, and even necessary. The way a leader responds to change can set the tone for others, affecting both the attitude of the group during the change as well as how successful the transition will be. So, leaders must be flexible and positive but must also be able to adapt quickly so that processes and procedures have a quick and smooth transition and others can move forward and adjust to a new way of being.', 51),
('Responding to Ambiguity', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Because leaders cannot truly control all circumstances and will never know all the answers, they must be able to respond to uncertainty and the unknown. Leaders need to be able to adapt quickly, change direction, and move forward without complete information so they can continue functioning during uncertainty. In addition, embracing that one\\''s plans might get altered or new information might be presented that require a change of course can allow the leader to handle ambiguity with less anxiety because the only thing that becomes predictable is unpredictability.', 52),
('Functioning Independently', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Being able to function independently is not only beneficial to an individual who is working independently, but it is also advantageous for that individual\\''s supervisor who may not have the time or interest to provide a lot of oversight, answer a great number of questions, or motivate someone to complete a task. Working independently can assist an individual to develop his or her confidence to complete a task without relying on the input of others, critical thinking skills to seek out answers without having to ask others, and follow-through and motivation by completing a task without being followed up with or reminded.

('Initiative', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Leadership often requires action, and a leader is willing to take charge in a situation either individually to fill a need or to help motivate the group to get moving on an idea or task. Leaders do not sit back and wait for someone else to step up; they make things happen. Their contribution may not only fill a need, but can motivate and inspire others to move forward.', 54),
('Follow-Through', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'People need to be able to depend on and trust each other to follow through on their commitments even when facing obstacles.

('Responsibility for Personal Behavior', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'All people make mistakes and bad choices on occasion. It is how one handles those situations that demonstrates leadership. Leaders do not defer responsibility, push blame on others, or cover up errors. They own up to their actions by admitting when they are wrong, apologizing, rectifying the situation, and accepting the consequences for their actions. Doing this demonstrates a leader\\''s honesty, integrity, and allows the leader to move forward in taking corrective action and learn from the experience so as not to make a mistake or bad choice in this circumstance in the future.', 56),
('Positive Attitude', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Life is full of unexpected challenges, changes, and actions by others that can be discouraging or defeating. Attitude plays an important role in how one deals with these circumstances. A leader with a positive attitude can foster a sense of optimism, hope, inspiration, and enthusiasm even if the circumstances are bad.

It is important that leaders can produce and distinguish useful, legitimate information that is most applicable to each leadership situation.  ', 1),
('Other Perspectives', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders do not have all the answers. Thus, it is essential that they are able to truly consider other opinions, experiences, and outlooks to help them develop better solutions and approaches when dealing with leadership situations. Not only can this lead to better outcomes, but considering other perspectives helps leaders relate to and appreciate others more by better understanding their viewpoints.', 2),
('Reflection and Application', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Being able to look at the past and better understand a situation, the strategies used, and the impact of decisions can help a leader learn what might work best in future situations. It is through learning from failures and successes of the past that leaders can better lead in future leadership situations.', 3),
('Systems Thinking', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leadership is about networks: individual, organizational, and community. A decision by one can have an impact far beyond the immediate scope of the decision maker. Therefore, leaders must be able to understand how networks work and be able to navigate through both the ripple effects of others\\'' decisions as well as engage in their own decision making that considers the impact on a larger network or system.', 4),
('Analysis', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders are confronted every day with decisions that may have a large impact financially, organizationally, politically, socially, and/or interpersonally. With this responsibility comes the great need to understand a situation in its entirety, all the individual pieces as well as the whole, to make meaning of the situation and make the best decision possible. ', 5),
('Synthesis', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'As the creation of information continues to grow, the demand for effectively managing that information is a necessary function of leadership. Leaders must be able to look at a variety of information, some seemingly unrelated, and connect that information to make sense of the bigger picture so that effective and sustainable decisions can be made.', 6),
('Evaluation', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders make difficult decisions every day. In order to make the best decision possible, leaders must be able to sift through a vast array of information with a critical eye, determining the use and importance of every piece of information received. Leaders must be able to look at all of this information and determine which information has the most impact on their situation and which information is just interesting. Navigating through this vast array of information and determining what is useful, to what extent, and how it is useful can help inform the leaders in making effective decisions. ', 7),
('Problem Solving', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Although everyone is confronted with problems, because leaders are connected to a larger system, problem solving can often have higher stakes for a group or organization. So, the ability to effectively solve problems is paramount for leaders. Effective problem solving has the opportunity to prevent damage, achieve a successful and productive outcome, refrain from negatively affecting others and in some cases positively affect others, and prevent a problem from reoccurring.', 8),
('Decision Making', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leaders are continually engaged in leadership situations that require decisions to be made. Each decision to be made is situated in a context that includes factors affecting a specific decision, such as people involved or affected, time, and resources. Understanding this context can help a leader make the most effective, productive, and sustainable decision appropriate for that exact situation.', 9),
('Idea Generation', 'LEARNING AND REASONING', 'Leadership issues are complex; they can involve a variety of people, perspectives, and circumstances. This complexity often does not call for a one size fits all approach. Therefore, it is vital that leaders are able to generate new ideas that effectively address issues in an ever-changing landscape. ', 10),
('Self-Understanding', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Self-awareness is vital to effective leadership. Not understanding how one might respond to change or working from one\\''s weaknesses while thinking they are strengths can have devastating impacts on others. However, when a leader understands his or her feelings, beliefs, actions, and personality, he or she can emphasize strengths and mitigate weaknesses in his or her leadership style and lead with more authenticity and in a more productive manner.', 11),
('Personal Values', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Values are a guiding force for individual behavior. Being aware of one\\''s own values can help a leader prioritize organizational initiatives and make decisions aligned with those values. And, leaders who demonstrate their values through leadership can inspire others to work with them. ', 12),
('Personal Contributions', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Everyone has assets, those aspects of themselves that are helpful and contributory, including ideas, strengths, knowledge, and abilities. Leaders who know what their assets are can tap into them to lead more effectively. A leader who contributes the strength of compassion when someone in the group falls on hard times can positively affect others, or a leader who contributes the ability of website design when others in the organization lack that ability can contribute positively to a needed task. Leaders give of themselves to make their organizations better.', 13),
('Scope of Competence', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Engaging in a task outside one\\''s capabilities can have harmful effects on others and organizations. Just as important as it is to know one\\''s own strengths, skills, and talents that one may bring to a situation, it is just as vital for a leader to know what he or she does not bring to the situation. By recognizing one\\''s own limitations, the leader can engage in those tasks that he or she is capable of and refer those outside of his or her scope of competence to others more competent at the task at hand. ', 14),
('Receiving Feedback', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'For a leader to continue to develop as well as enhance his or her effectiveness with others, being self-aware is essential. Sometimes, however, a leader cannot simply self-assess his or her own competencies or behavior because there are elements that are not visible to the leader in the same way as they are to others. So, these areas often either go unaddressed or are not addressed in the best manner. Being able to consider feedback from others is crucial for a leader to best develop his or her competencies and increase his or her effectiveness with others.', 15),
('Self-Development', 'SELF-AWARENESS AND DEVELOPMENT', 'Whether it is learning new technology or how to become a better public speaker, leaders are always learning. They may do this voluntarily, like seeking out training, or out of necessity based on the leader\\''s role or the group\\''s needs.', 16),
('Productive Relationships', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leadership requires that a leader has meaningful connections with others; simply interacting with people does not constitute a relationship. A leader who cultivates productive, mutually beneficial relationships with others can create a trusting environment in which people care about each other. This allows for channels of communication to open for the emergence of new ideas and honest dialogue, a personal and professional support structure to develop, and a shared commitment for a vision or task to be created.', 17),
('Appropriate Interaction', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Everyone is different, whether because of a situation, a personality, or a set of circumstances. Leaders must understand this context and gauge their interactions to respect the boundaries, needs, and styles of others. ', 18),
('Helping Others', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are times in people\\''s jobs, families, or personal lives in which they could benefit from assistance, whether to make something less difficult or less time consuming. Because leaders care about people, they know how valuable it is to help others and foster an environment in which people help each other. ', 19),
('Others Contributions', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leaders know that the unique ideas, strengths, knowledge, and abilities that individuals bring to a task or relationship are assets, because no one person has every great idea or a mastery of all competencies, and certainly leaders cannot do it all alone. Leaders understand this and integrate others\\'' ideas, strengths, and abilities to better address an issue, strengthen a relationship, solve a problem, or engage in innovation.   ', 20),
('Empathy', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Empathy plays an important role in leadership. Not only can demonstrating empathy with others build relationships and a sense of trust, it can also help a leader understand another point of view or other set of circumstances to effectively inform the leader', 21),
('Supervision', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'In many cases, leaders oversee the work of others, whether formally or informally. Thus, it is essential that leaders are able to effectively provide direction to those they supervise so they are clear about what they need to do, the process for doing it, and any expectations the leader has. This direction can provide a sense of clarity and transparency so that others are best situated to complete their intended jobs or tasks.', 22),
('Providing Feedback', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Feedback includes critiques, confirmations, and/or advice that can help another person improve their decisions, effectiveness, productivity, or interactions with others. As a leader, being able to provide feedback to others is essential. This feedback not only assists the one receiving the feedback, but if the feedback that is given is utilized, this can have a positive impact on group functioning and group productivity.', 23),
('Mentoring', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'It is vital that leaders share their knowledge, ability, and/or experience with more novice individuals to help them develop their capacities. Doing so is not just good for the individual, but developing the capacities of others could contribute to team productivity, a greater sense of trust, more group legitimacy, and allow for the workload to be more evenly distributed.', 24),
('Empowerment', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'Leaders understand the benefit of empowering others. Sharing power, information, and resources allows others to have an investment in a task or process and can provide them a sense of ownership, accountability, and commitment. This may lead to higher-quality work, greater timeliness and follow-through, and greater commitment to the task and team. ', 25),
('Motivation', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are many factors that can influence someone\\''s motivation to complete a task or goal. Some people may be motivated by internal factors such as drive and desire, whereas others may be motivated by external factors like rewards and incentives. It is essential for the leader to understand the unique ways in which people are motivated and engage in specific strategies that motivate each person in the way that is most effective for him or her.', 26),
('Collaboration', 'INTERPERSONAL INTERACTION', 'There are a variety of situations in which it is more beneficial to work together than to work independently. These may include solving a challenging problem, addressing an ethical dilemma, or simply completing a comprehensive project. Being able to work together allows a multitude of voices and ideas to be considered, an enhanced sense of group commitment and responsibility to occur, and the human power to execute a task to increase. Leaders foster a culture of collaboration and seek to bring people together in intentional ways to benefit the group.', 27),
('Organizational Behavior', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Organizations can be living entities, with the organization and its individuals creating and sustaining their own sense of culture, norms, and practices. Leaders need not only to understand the organization but also to anticipate, navigate, mitigate, and respond effectively to the behaviors of the organization and those in it to lead most effectively in the organizational context.', 28),
('Power Dynamics', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Whether formal or informal, internal and external power dynamics affect nearly every group. These power dynamics may be influenced by position, seniority, resource access, and/or relationships of the group\\''s members or stakeholders. It is vital that leaders understand the types of power dynamics that exist in their groups so they can better respond to the group\\''s needs within the context of these power dynamics.', 29),
('Group Development', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Working together is not just about achieving an outcome; it is about participating in a process. Leaders need to pay attention to the group process ensuring that the group feels a sense of connection and commitment to both the group and to its members. This connection and commitment can foster a sense of trust through which members share ideas, give feedback, follow through, and make difficult decisions. By understanding how groups form and develop, the leader can help foster group development and thus enhance the group\\''s efficiency and effectiveness in an empowering manner.', 30),
('Creating Change', 'GROUP DYNAMICS', 'Nothing stays the same; people change, environments change, and organizations change. Not only is change inevitable, it can be challenging for people, structures, and processes. And, if change is not instituted well, it can be damaging to the group and its members. Thus, it is imperative that when leaders enact change, they are sensitive to the context and people involved.', 31),
('Diversity', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leadership is inherently an interpersonal process, and in many situations, leaders will find themselves in the position of working with individuals who have different backgrounds, beliefs, and/or experiences than they do. The variety of diverse perspectives of those in the group can enhance a group\\''s effectiveness. Instead of a decision being made from only one or maybe two vantage points, differing perspectives can be considered and integrated into the decision. This allows for a decision to not only be more comprehensive, but also more inclusive.', 32),
('Others Circumstances', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'It is critical for leaders to seek to understand the situations and/or conditions of other people. This understanding not only helps inform the leader\\''s decisions but also helps the leader be conscious of what others have experienced or are experiencing so as to engage in inclusive behaviors and connect with others with a sense of care.', 33),
('Social Justice', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leadership exists within a larger social system that often involves an inequitable distribution of social power. Effective leaders have an understanding of social power and the inequities that exist in the distribution of that power, as well as a motivation to lessen or eliminate those inequities. Socially just leaders act in ways that work towards a more equitable distribution of social power and challenge individuals, groups, and systems that reinforce inequity.', 34),
('Inclusion', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leaders do not just lead abstract groups of people for abstract causes; they lead with people and for people. Because people like to feel included, whether to share their viewpoints, contribute to a cause or task, or simply feel a sense of belonging, leaders must foster an inclusive environment.', 35),
('Social Responsibility', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Leaders often have the ability to greatly affect others and society through their decisions and actions, whether that effect is positive or negative. Thus, it is vital that leaders engage in responsible decision making and ethical actions so that the impact they leave benefits and does not detract from the welfare of society and its members. ', 36),
('Service', 'CIVIC RESPONSIBILITY', 'Serving one\\''s community is essential in creating and maintaining a thriving community. Whether that service is through participation in community processes and decision making, collaborative initiatives, or volunteer positions or experiences, communities are only as strong as their members\\'' commitment and engagement. Leaders model this commitment and engagement to their communities by finding meaningful ways, personally and/or professionally, to participate in service that positively contributes to their communities.', 37),
('Verbal Communication', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Although the context in which they would need to do it varies greatly, leaders frequently need to be able to communicate effectively with others through spoken word, including oral communication, sign language, and/or communication using assistive technology. This may take the form of speaking in front of a crowd, delivering a presentation, running a meeting, or conversing with someone one-on-one, among many others. Regardless of its delivery method, effective verbal communication allows a leader to inform, inspire, influence, counsel, and negotiate in a non-written format.', 38),
('Nonverbal Communication', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Effective communication is more than just communicating words; it is also about body language, gestures, and other cues that convey meaning. Being able to effectively communicate nonverbally allows leaders to fully express their intended meaning and show that they care and they are listening.', 39),
('Listening', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Effective communication is more than just communicating messages to another person; it also involves receiving messages by listening. Leaders know that effective listening can help prevent miscommunication, as well as allow the leader to better understand messages being communicated, gather ideas and feedback, and demonstrate a sense of care about what others want to communicate. ', 40),
('Writing', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Whether writing out a vision or strategic plan, developing a proposal, writing a performance evaluation of another person, or communicating electronically, leaders need to be able to communicate effectively through writing. Failure to write effectively can result in missed opportunities, miscommunication, or even misrepresentation of oneself and one\\''s organization. Effective writing can help leaders organize ideas, showcase accomplishments, and inspire and influence others especially when other forms of communication are not an option.', 41),
('Facilitation', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Groups are powerful engines of problem solving, innovation, and decision-making. To best utilize the group process, leaders need to be able to lead discussions effectively, ask the right questions, and synthesize information. Doing this enables groups to maximize their potential in solving challenging problems, generating new ideas, and making difficult decisions.', 42),
('Conflict Negotiation', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Conflict is inevitable. Leaders may be involved in the conflict or helping others negotiate through the conflict. Regardless, conflict happens. Avoiding or mishandling conflict can result in strained relationships, difficulty for people to work together, and issues of trust; it even has the potential to escalate into acts of harm. To create a safe, respectful, and trusting environment, leaders must be adept at negotiating conflict.', 43),
('Advocating for a Point of View', 'COMMUNICATION', 'Leaders can have opinions about many issues, causes, situations, and ideas. Leaders may strongly favor one thing and maybe just as strongly not favor another. Effectively communicating what they believe is not easy. So, not only does the communication itself need to be clear and understandable to convey the intended meaning, the leader needs to deliver the information in an influential yet respectful manner. Being able to do this ensures the effective transmission of the message as well as allows the leader to demonstrate a commitment to his or her values, exhibit passion, show others that he or she is willing to put his or her reputation on the line to stand by an opinion, and even convince others to believe what he or she believes.', 44),
('Mission', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Knowing one\\''s values and leading with them is vital to individual and organizational leadership. Because a mission statement is a summary of an individualï¿½s or organizationï¿½s values, it can serve as a decision-making compass that ensures that all decisions are made in alignment with the values. On an organizational level, having a mission statement that reflects the values of the organization and its members can help provide guidance and justification for engaging in particular behaviors and can serve as a binding force for those in the organization who stand behind the values. ', 45),
('Vision', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'A vision is an aspiration based on what one imagines the possibilities to be in the future; it is a picture of what one wants the future to look like, as an individual, organization, or community. By having a vision in place, a leader can develop goals, plans, and strategies that align with the vision so as to stay on track, keep motivated, and monitor his or her progress toward achieving the vision. In addition, a vision can create a sense of unity between people as they are inspired to achieve the same outcome.', 46),
('Goals', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Attempting to achieve a vision can be an overwhelming and daunting task because the vision can be very large and/or take place over a lengthy time span. Thus, it is essential to break the vision down into smaller, measurable, and more readily achievable goals that contribute to the achievement of the larger vision. By achieving these goals, one can measure progress towards the vision as well as feel a sense of accomplishment along the way.', 47),
('Plan', 'STRATEGIC PLANNING', 'Leaders can be grand thinkers, big dreamers, and aspire to do things no one has ever done. But how do leaders get themselves, others, and their organizations to achieve great things? They must be able to develop a plan to get there. In an effort to reach goals or simply engage in day-to-day organizational operations, leaders must be adept at planning. They must be able to identify tasks and set deadlines so that there is a roadmap in place to get where the leader wants to go.', 48),
('Ethics', 'PERSONAL BEHAVIOR', 'Leaders are not exempt from the standards others are held accountable to; leaders are the model that others follow.
